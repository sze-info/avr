# Semester Project

Completing the semester project requires more time, but it allows for the development of much more interesting tasks over several weeks. Based on the semester project, after completing the course, you can even create a thesis, dissertation, project work, or TDK paper, and there is also the possibility of fulfilling the mandatory professional practice.

## Examples

Example of a semester project prepared by the instructors:

- [github.com/horverno/simple_random_trees](https://github.com/horverno/simple_random_trees): This package uses a simple random tree algorithm for path planning. Its implementation focuses on visualization rather than a comprehensive random tree-based path planning system. The `/display_tree node` advertises a `/path_marker_topic`, which is of type `visualization_msgs/marker_array`. The functions implementing the tree data structure are placed in separate header files. Implemented under `ROS 2 Humble`.

The following examples were not necessarily created as semester projects but would be acceptable as such:

- [github.com/jkk-research/wayp_plan_tools](https://github.com/jkk-research/wayp_plan_tools)
- [github.com/jkk-research/sim_wayp_plan_tools](https://github.com/jkk-research/sim_wayp_plan_tools)
- [github.com/jkk-research/pointcloud_to_grid](https://github.com/jkk-research/pointcloud_to_grid)
- [github.com/jkk-research/urban_road_filter](https://github.com/jkk-research/urban_road_filter)
- [github.com/dobaybalazs/curb_detection](https://github.com/dobaybalazs/curb_detection)
- [github.com/kkira07/Szakdolgozat](https://github.com/kkira07/Szakdolgozat)
- [github.com/szenergy/rviz_markers](https://github.com/szenergy/rviz_markers)
- [github.com/linklab-uva/f1tenth_gtc_tutorial](https://github.com/linklab-uva/f1tenth_gtc_tutorial)
- [github.com/Farraj007/Jkk-task](https://github.com/Farraj007/Jkk-task)
- [github.com/leander-dsouza/breakout_gazebo](https://github.com/leander-dsouza/breakout_gazebo)
- [github.com/fjp/ros-turtle-pong](https://github.com/fjp/ros-turtle-pong)

*Note*: We use the ROS 2 Humble version in the course, but the semester project (with justification) can be accepted in other versions as well.

## Positive aspects of the *semester* task:
- üëç Well-followed documentation in Hungarian and/or English, illustrated with images. Use of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
- üëç Basic information in the `README.md`, (optional) documentation in the `/wiki`.
- üëç Issues.
- üëç Branches.
- üëç Gitignore.
- üëç License.
- üëç Repository topics, including the course code and SZE. Based on the topics, the repository can also be listed here: [github.com/topics/sze](https://github.com/topics/sze).
- üëç Extra points can be awarded if the current material is supplemented/corrected (naturally through a pull request).

## *Serious mistakes* that can significantly lower the grade of the *semester* project:
- üò° Compressed files in the GitHub repository (e.g., `zip` and even worse, `rar`). An exception can be made if the goal is direct compressed file handling, but source code, images, etc., should never be uploaded this way.
- üò° [Not original work](#meme), or the borrowed code is not referenced.
- üò° In a team, only one student commits. (This obviously does not apply to single-person tasks).
- üò° Few commits. The appropriate number of commits is important because it allows us to judge how the workflow progressed, who worked on what and when.
- üò° No `README.md`, missing brief documentation or images.
- üò° Documentation uploaded as pdf/docx instead of in the `/wiki`.
- üò° File upload instead of commit.
- üò° Source code screenshotted instead of using markdown syntax highlighting. (Since code in images cannot be copied, searched, etc.).

## Ideas for topic selection

- Inspiration can be found in previous or current theses/dissertations: [horverno.github.io/temaajanlatok](https://horverno.github.io/temaajanlatok/)
- It is advisable to choose a topic that you would enjoy working on for weeks/months. If, for example, visualization, algorithm practice, 3D, or artificial intelligence is appealing, then it is advisable to choose a topic accordingly.
- Previous theses, semester projects are available and can be requested [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtMK--IQl4v5pHiATDP4MJwuU-M0Ycd2keMndQfuuhvlr1rA/viewform?usp=sf_link). It is important that these **must not** be shared further, they are available for educational purposes only.
- Numerous ROS 2 projects here: [github.com/fkromer/awesome-ros2](https://github.com/fkromer/awesome-ros2)

!!! tip
    It is highly recommended to obtain the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which includes [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
    You can read more about it here: [sze-info.github.io/ajr/bevezetes/copilot/#github-copilot-beszerzese-sze-hallgatoknak](https://sze-info.github.io/ajr/bevezetes/copilot/#github-copilot-beszerzese-sze-hallgatoknak)

## Evaluation criteria

The criteria were developed based on the evaluation criteria of a similar course at [√ìbuda University](https://abc-irobotics.github.io/ros_course_materials_hu/#evkozi-jegy_1).
- The ratio of own work to the used codebase (with proper references)
- Work producing evaluable results
- The quality of the presentation (ppt, videos, live demo, any additional tools used)
- The completeness of the solution
- Proper `ROS 2` communication / best practice application
- The structure of the program
- The quality of the implementation
- The documentation of the code
- Consultation
- The difficulty of the chosen task

## Recommended method for creating the semester repo: `template`

We have created a so-called template repo in both C++ and Python, which makes it easier to create the first repository containing a package:

- [github.com/sze-info/ros2_cpp_template](https://github.com/sze-info/ros2_cpp_template)
- [github.com/sze-info/ros2_py_template](https://github.com/sze-info/ros2_py_template)
