### Installation

Available:

- [github.com/vectr-ucla/direct_lidar_inertial_odometry/tree/feature/ros2](https://github.com/vectr-ucla/direct_lidar_inertial_odometry/tree/feature/ros2) ROS 2 branch
- [github.com/jkk-research/direct_lidar_inertial_odometry](https://github.com/jkk-research/direct_lidar_inertial_odometry) fork containing only the ROS 2 branch

Let's check if `pcl-ros`
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-pcl-ros
```

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkk-research/direct_lidar_inertial_odometry
```

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/
```

```bash
colcon build --packages-select direct_lidar_inertial_odometry
```
### Building the package 

``` bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/
```

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/PRBonn/kiss-icp
```

``` bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/
```

``` bash
colcon build --packages-select kiss_icp
```

### Launch  

``` bash
ros2 launch kiss_icp odometry.launch.py topic:=/lexus3/os_left/points
```
