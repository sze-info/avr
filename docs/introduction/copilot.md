# Copilot

GitHub Copilot is a programming assistant tool: [github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). It is based on AI technologies, similar to ChatGPT. It is particularly useful for beginner programmers but can also be a great help for experienced developers. GitHub Copilot assists developers in writing, completing, and correcting code, suggests coding patterns and structures, and helps developers solve problems faster.

GitHub Copilot supports multiple programming languages, making it useful for various development tasks, such as robotics development, database management, mobile application development, and many other areas.

The tool integrates into development environments like Visual Studio Code and can be used directly within the application.

By default, it is a paid service, but it is free with student access: [education.github.com/benefits](https://education.github.com/benefits?type=student).
